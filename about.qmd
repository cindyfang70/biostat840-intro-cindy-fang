I am currently a first-year PhD Student in Biostatistics and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Prior to this, I completed my BS at the University of Toronto in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology.

In my free time, I enjoy cooking, working out, listening to music, and reading.
